Configuration files for setting up nginx, Gunicorn, and Supervisor

Installation:

Edit each file changing paths to your django app

create a sym link for nginx
ln -s $PWD/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/{project_name}.conf

do the same for supervisor
ln -s $PWD/supervisor.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/{project_name}.conf

restart nginx and supervisor
service nginx restart
service supervisor restart

check that supervisor is running your app
supervisorctl status

you should get output similar to
{project_name}                          RUNNING    pid 827, uptime 0:12:29
